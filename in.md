### What is Risk?

2 types of Risk

* Positive Risk - losing the profits (unrealised profits) due to some incidents and all profits vanish. Unless profit is booked it is unrealised and carry risk of losing those profits
* Negative Risk - Value lower than the acquisition price. Something bought and after that value gone down

### Categories of Stocks : Based on their Value Proposition

![](img/in49.png)
![](img/in50.png)

![](img/in52.png)

ITC is more value stock because of its Cigarette business which brings in huge profit. But because of Govt. regulations and increase in taxes ITC always like cat on wall. So investors feel risky stock and its value is often cheap. Hence considered value stock. Also compare P/E ratio of ITC with its peers. Lesser P/E when compared to industry P/E & peers P/E means then its price is more cheap

* ITC P/E - 19.2
* Hindustan Unilever P/E - 76.5
* Nestle India P/E - 78.1
* Titan P/E - 179.93
* Industry P/E - 35.54

### The Skeptic’s world

Skeptic - someone who doubts frequently

![](img/in71.png)

### An Inquisitive Mind

Just curious about what's happening around us and what are all business evolves and how it does. When going to shopping mall, just take a look around there are lot of shops, check whether those companies are listed, who owns it, can we invest it? Buy the products from the shops if you have already invested, in this way you are contributing to your investments. Need Child's mind of looking at things and curious to know and figure out what it is

## THE FRAMEWORK OF ANALYSIS

### Economic Analysis

On the long run, Analysing Economy of the Country where you are investing is very much important. NOT only analysing the indepth Fundamentals and Technicals of the company or sector is enough, you have to analyse National economy and GDP growth for long term investments. If you want to have relation with Stock market for decades then understand the economy is very much essential.

Due to philosophy of Socialism, that for everything we need to approach Government it became hard to common people.  
For example, for setting up a business you have bride or corrupt Govt. office employees from office Assistant (peon) to higher officials.  
In 1980’s country's economy and growth stumbled because of this and faced huge block.

#### Dish TV
![](img/in153.png)
#### Punjab National Bank

![](img/in154.png)
![](img/in155.png)

### Holdings, Subsidiaries and Associates

Company Holdings - One company holds shares of other company  

A company is said to be a Subsidiary if its share holding by Holding company is greater or equal to 50%  
A company is said to be a Associate if its share holding by Holding company is less than 50% and greater or equal to 20%

![](img/in156.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in157.png)
![](img/in158.png)

### Standalone vs Consolidated statements

![](img/in161.png)

* **Standalone -** Results or Numbers of that core company only  
* **Consolidated -** Standalone +  Results or Numbers of the subsidiary and associate companies 

Consolidated is the overall P/L of thier company and also P/L from the shares they hold from other companies (subsidiary & associates)  
When a company holds shares in other company then their P/L also impacts the holding company overall P/L.  
So it is mandatory to check consolidated results as well.

![](img/in176.png)

### Pledging of shares 

Giving Shares as collateral and getting money. This mostly happens with Banks. Promotors pledge their shares and get money for various reasons like to increase stake in the company, personal reasons, etc. But once shares are pledged, Banks give warnings to Promotor that if in case failing to repay debt in time, Banks has the right to sell the shares.  

In the case of nasty Promotor, if he already knew that the company is not performing well and the stock price is gonna fall, then he would pledge his shares to get money and then default by not paying the money back. At that time stock price at least would have fallen a little down. Because of defaulting, Banks are forced to sell those shares in the open market to recover the money back. But the stock price is already falling down and when banks start to sell, what happens is more supply but less demand. So stock price falls steeply and banks cannot recover money because they are selling shares for a cheaper price. Hence banks are affected and sometimes can become bankrupt.

### How to Read Annual Reports like a Pro

Download and Read the Annual report only if you think that company is worth investing in. For example. If Auditor has raised a red flag for a company or if the promotor of the company has pledged too many shares like ZEE media then don't even think about these companies and no question of investing. So why read their annual reports?  
Just keep it simple, read annual reports of companies who are worthy enough for our time & effort  

Annual Reports can be downloaded from Company website or from [screener.in](https://www.screener.in)
![](img/in147.png)
#### **Reliance Industries**

![](img/in192.png)

Analyze Revenue and Profit. Sometimes Revenue can be misleading because Revenue could be high but the profit gained could be very low. So compare Revenue against profit.  
Margin = Profit / Revenue. So analyze businesses with high Margin. 

![](img/in193.png)
![](img/in194.png)
![](img/in195.png)
![](img/in196.png)
![](img/in197.png)
![](img/in198.png)
![](img/in199.png)
![](img/in200.png)

Just check the performance and management comment on their core business at least to get their insights of business and future plans. Do not take too much info, just read the brief and know the necessary details of is it worth investing your hard-earned money in this company over a long-term period.

### Reading Notes

Notes has to be checked when you see drastic change in numbers for current year when comparing with last couple of years. It can be Balance sheet, cash flow statement or P/L statement. Whenever you see huge difference in terms of either profit or loss you have to basically check notes to understand why this has happened. That is whenever you see something and if that creates some sort of supicion and if you think it has to be explained, then go through notes to know it deep

**For example.** 

1. If Profit or Loss is increased significantly high then check read notes to find out why and how it has happened. 
2. If Other income is huge number when compared to core business profit then it creates curiosity of from where this money comes from, so have to check notes for more information on it

![](img/in201.png)
![](img/in202.png)

## BALANCE SHEET

### Getting started – with you!

![](img/in203.png)

Assume this your P/L statement and Balance Sheet. If possible put in your own real numbers and check what is the performance? If you understand this then it is easy to follow the statements of companies and predict the impact of it in their stocks.

![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in244.png)
![](img/in245.png)

### Current assets

**Any asset which can be converted into cash within next 12 months is called Current assets.** 

![](img/in246.png)
![](img/in247.png)
![](img/in248.png)
![](img/in249.png)

![](img/in253.png)
![](img/in254.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in255.png)
![](img/in256.png)

Most of the Current assets are Intangible assets.  
You can notice for B2B company trade receivables is huge because of payment terms.  
Whereas for B2C company trade receivables is less because of cash is paid in upfront when product is delivered

### Non-Current assets  

![](img/in246.png)
![](img/in257.png)
![](img/in258.png)
![](img/in259.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in260.png)
![](img/in261.png)

Always check note, whenever you see big numbers in Current and Non-Current assets then do check why is it so?  
Any abnormal indication or doubt then check in full swing to understand what and where the money is from or into?

### Liabilities

### Liabilities – Current vs Non-Current

**Current Liability -** Has to repay within next 12 months. Most dangerous    
**Non-Current Liability -** Long term debt has to repay in future. But its not compulsion to repay within next 12 months

![](img/in272.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in274.png)
![](img/in273.png)

### Key Ratios : Current Ratio

* Current ratio > 3 = Excellent company
* Current ratio > 2 = Good company
* Current ratio > 1 = Better company
* Current ratio < 1 = Bad company, rethink before investing
* Current ratio < 0.5 = Worst, don't even think about it

### Equity Share Capital

Equity shared capital - Funds raised by giving out shares of the company

![](img/in292.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in293.png)
![](img/in294.png)

### When you buy a stock, are you adding to share capital?

NO. Because basically, you are buying from the secondary market that is from another trader not from the company directly. Only when we directly buy from the company through IPO or FPO then it gets contributed to Equity share capital.

### Other Equity

### What about the Balance Sheet?

![](img/in322.png)
![](img/in323.png)
![](img/in324.png)
![](img/in325.png)
![](img/in326.png)

Let's End Mr.Singh's example over here. So we learnt about the difference between Expenditure and Expenses. Also knew about Depreciation which is in P/L statement and Accumulated Depreciation in Balance Sheet

### Income/Revenue

![](img/in327.png)

The money that is generated by selling their products or services is called Income or Revenue.  
In India we follow, IND AS (Indian Accounting standard) to report financials.   
Every public company follows this standard hence it is easy for us to go through the report to compare and understand the line items with respect to every other company

![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in328.png)
![](img/in329.png)

### Expenses: Cost of material consumed

Margin = Revenue - Expenses

![](img/in330.png)
![](img/in331.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in332.png)
![](img/in333.png)
![](img/in334.png)
![](img/in335.png)

### Expenses: Purchase of Stock-in Trade

![](img/in336.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in337.png)
![](img/in338.png)
![](img/in339.png)

### Expenses: Change in Inventories

Inventory - Raw material or work-in-progress product or Finished product. It can be any of these three.  
For ex. Maruti Company - Tyres in warehouse or cars under production or cars in showroom for sale. All these are Inventory

Change in Inventory is for Matching purpose.  
Matching means "Matching the Revenue with Expenses during that period"

![](img/in340.png)
![](img/in341.png)
![](img/in342.png)

When Change in Inventory is in negative, then it means "More products were produced than actually what was sold"  
When Change in Inventory is in positive, then it means "Less products were produced than actually what was sold"

![](img/in147.png)
#### Larsen & Toubro
![](img/in343.png)

#### Reliance
![](img/in344.png)

### Expenses: Employee Benefits

![](img/in345.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in346.png)

IT Sector spends more money for its employees. Hence lavish lifestyle for IT people

![](img/in347.png)

Manufacturing sectors spends more only on its raw materials and hence spends less on employee expenses

![](img/in348.png)

### Expenses: Depreciation

![](img/in349.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in350.png)

If Depreciation is a minimal amount then exclude it from your analysis. If it is huge number then definitely check why it is and how it impacts the profits of the company.

![](img/in351.png)

### Expenses: Amortisation

![](img/in352.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in353.png)

Ignore Amortisation in your analysis. Not of that much important

![](img/in354.png)

### Expenses: Finance costs

### Expenses: Exceptional Items

![](img/in359.png)
![](img/in360.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in361.png)

Can dig deeper by reading notes on what that exceptional items are

![](img/in362.png)
![](img/in363.png)

### Expenses: Other costs

![](img/in364.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in365.png)

If Other Expenses is significantly high then it is always good to check Notes and understand what it is & why?

![](img/in366.png)

### Types of profits

![](img/in367.png)

Important to understand the types and will be useful while learning Financial ratios

![](img/in368.png)

## CASH FLOW STATEMENT

### Is profit the same as cash?

This is why Cash Flow Statment is so much important. What if for the next year if he needs more than 5L to run his business then obviously he would borrow money and that would leave him with some interest expense and hence profit goes down. So this is how P/L statement can misguide Investors.   
Therefore Profit is not equal to Cash. Cash has significance in running business. If you run out of cash then business gets impact.  
**Always check Cash Flow Statement of companies you invest.**

### Operating Activities

Operating activities list is very long. That is the work of CA to figure out whether this is activity or not and if it is then to which type of activity it belongs to. Here we should be see the big picture. Just check the activities of the company involving core business. Let's say for example we take Maruti then activities would be

- Manufacturing 
- Distribution
- Marketing
- Sales

### Introduction to Financial Ratios

![](img/in407.png)

Financial ratios save us a lot of time. A lot of time is required to analyze one company so think of analyzing a hundred companies because at end of the day we are looking for the best-performing companies to invest our money and become part of the company. Hence it is a tedious process so therefore we come up with Financial ratios to at least filter out the companies. Just understand what these ratios mean and represent. Also, have some thumb rules for the thresholds beyond which the company becomes acceptable or unacceptable as an Investor.  

It is the first level of analyzing the company using financial ratios. There are many types of ratios are available but we will look into only the important ones and safely ignore which are not significant.

**Usage of Financial Ratios**

Operating profit comes from the core business. Net profit can sometimes may mislead you because company may get most of its profits from some other source apart from core business. So as an Investor we should invest in companies where core business is fine and most profits comes out of it.
