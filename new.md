## FUTURES

### Forward Contract

Up until late 1990s only Forward contracts were there and no F&O. Even till date Forward contract exists but only for banks, businesses & big institutions. Agreement b/w 2 parties buyers and sellers. there is no 3rd party involved.  
Over the counter - that is no automation, have to talk, decide and buy contract only on physical presence

For ex. Buyer wants to buy gold after 3 months at 1500$. If seller agrees then contract is drawn b/w parties. Seller charges some money as premium basically fees which doesn't matter. Buyer's intention price will go up. Seller's intention price will fall down. Either one will be profitable. Both of them are liable i.e. should obey the contract.

### Introduction to Futures

NSE introduced Futures in Indian stock market. Very similar concept like Forward contracts but eliminates all negative risks. Buyers have positive view of price will go up and Sellers have negative view of price will go down. 3rd party involved that is the stock exchange.   
Derivates are instruments whose price is derived from its underlying asset.  
For ex. NIFTY MAR FUT price is derived from NIFTY

At the time of expiry, spot price and future price converge i.e. it'll be almost same. Because the time factor is 0. No more time left for future contract so the price is same as spot price

Daily settlements - Profits or Losses are settled on your account everyday. this is done to avoid risk of default
