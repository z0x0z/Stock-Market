#### What does a trader look for in an IPO

1. **Listing Gains -** That is after subscribing to IPO and when shares are allocated to trader (for ex. at 100rs) and on the day that stock gets lists on the exchange (for ex. at 120rs) how much listing gains is possible (in this case it is 20%) [chance of loss also can happen]  
2. **Trading Opportunities -** If the stock price goes up than the price which the trader got shares alloted then it is profit. Have to check for overall market sentiment towards that stock. 


#### Steps to do as a Trader

* Information Gathering - Know as much as info about the company  
* Get Red Herring Prospectus - All info about IPO is there  
* Get Promotor information - check his credibility and history  
* Check other company info by same Promotor - If promotor promotes other companies, what is his role & how well is it  
* What does the company do - Dig little deeper to find what all company does & their source of revenue  
* Industry info - Which Industry & Sector the company belongs to and who are all its competitors for their core business  
* Competitor info - Are the competitors listed and their performance in the market
