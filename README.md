# STOCK MARKET

## Why to Invest

1. **Fight Inflation** – By investing one can deal better with the inevitable – growing cost of living – generally referred to as Inflation
2. **Create Wealth** – By investing, one can aim to have a better corpus by the end of the defined time period. In the above example, the time period was up to retirement, but it can be anything – children’s education, marriage, house purchase, retirement holidays, etc
3. To meet life’s financial aspiration

## Where to invest?

* **Fixed income instruments** - These are investable instruments with minimal risk to the principle, and the return is paid as an interest to the investor ex. FD, Bonds issued by Govt of India, Bonds issued by Corporate's 
* **Equity** - Mutual funds, Stock market
* **Real estate**
* **Commodities** (precious metals)

## Regulators

In India, the stock market regulator is called **The Securities and Exchange Board of India**, often referred to as SEBI.
In general, SEBI ensures:

The stock exchanges *(BSE and NSE)* conducts its business fairly
Stockbrokers and sub-brokers conduct their business fairly
Participants don’t get involved in unfair practices
Corporate’s don’t use the markets to unduly benefit themselves (Example – Satyam Computers)
Small retail investors interests are protected
Large investors with huge cash pile should not manipulate the markets
Overall development of markets

## Financial Intermediaries

### 1. Stock broker 
A stockbroker is a corporate entity, registered as a trading member with the stock exchange and holds a stockbroking license. A stockbroker is your gateway to stock exchanges. First, you need to open something called a **‘Trading Account’** with a broker who meets your requirements.  
A trading account lets you carry financial transactions in the market. A trading account is an account with the broker, which lets the investor buy/sell securities.

The basic services provided by the brokers include…

1. Give you access to markets and letting you transact
1. Give you margins for trading – We will discuss this point at a later stage.
1. Provide support – Dealing support if you have to call and trade. Software support if you have issues with the trading terminal
1. Issue contract notes for the transactions – A contract note is a written confirmation detailing the transactions you have carried out during the day.
1. Facilitate the fund transfer between your trading and bank account
1. Provide you with a back-office login – using which you can see the summary of your account
1. The broker charges a fee for the services he provides called the ‘brokerage charge’ or just brokerage. The brokerage rates vary, and it’s upto you to find a broker who strikes a balance between the fee he collects versus the services he provides.

### 2. Depository and Depository Participants

Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format; however post 1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. Converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called “Dematerialization” often abbreviated as DEMAT. The share certificate in DEMAT format has to be stored digitally. The storage place for the digital share certificate is the **‘DEMAT Account’**.  
A Depository is a financial intermediary which offers the service of the Demat account. A DEMAT account in your name will have all the shares in the electronic format you bought. Think of the DEMAT account as a digital vault for your shares.  
your broker’s trading account and the DEMAT account from the Depository are interlinked.  

At present, only two depositaries are offering you DEMAT account services. They are The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited. There is virtually no difference between the two, and both of them operate under strict SEBI regulations.

Just like the way you cannot walk into National Stock Exchange’s office to open a trading account, you cannot walk into a Depository to open a DEMAT account. To open a DEMAT account, you need to liaison with a Depository Participant (DP). A DP helps you set up your DEMAT account with a Depository. A DP acts as an agent to the Depository. Needless to say, even the DP is governed by the regulations laid out by the SEBI.

### 3. Banks

Banks help in facilitating the fund transfer from your bank account to your trading account. You cannot transfer money from a bank account that is not in your name.  
You can link multiple bank accounts to your trading through which you can transfer funds and trade. At Zerodha, you can add 1 primary bank account and up to 2 secondary bank accounts. You can use all the bank accounts to add funds, but withdrawals are only processed to the primary bank account. Also, dividend payments, money from buybacks will be sent to the primary bank account.

The three financial intermediaries operate via three different accounts – ***trading account, DEMAT account and Bank account***. All three accounts operate electronically and are interlinked, giving you a very seamless experience.

### 4. NSCCL and ICCL

NSCCL – National Security Clearing Corporation Ltd and Indian Clearing Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries of National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange.
The job of the clearing corporation is to ensure guaranteed settlement of your trades/transactions.  
For all practical purposes, it’s ok not to know much about NSCCL or ICCL simply because, you as a trader or investor would not be interacting with these agencies directly. You need to be aware that certain professional institutions are heavily regulated and work towards a smooth settlement and efficient clearing activity.

## The IPO Markets 

### Origin of a Business

#### Angel Investors. 
They believe in **Promotors** (Founders of the company) and invest money. So let us imagine that the promoter, along with the angels, raises INR 5 Crore in the capital. This initial money that he gets to kick start his business is called **‘The Seed Fund’**. It is important to note that the seed fund will not sit in the entrepreneur’s (also called the promoter) personal bank account but instead sits in its bank account. Once the seed capital hits the company’s bank account, the money will be referred to as the company’s initial share capital.

In return for the initial seed investment, the original three (promoter plus 2 angels) will be issued share certificates of the company which entitles them to the company.

The only asset that the company has at this stage is the cash of INR 5 Crs, the company’s value is also INR 5 Crs. This is called the company’s **valuation**.  
Issuing shares is quite simple; the company assumes that each share is worth Rs.10 and because there is Rs.5 crore as share capital, there have to be 50 lakh shares with each share worth Rs.10. In this context, Rs.10 is called the ‘Face value’ (FV) of the share. The face value could be any number. If the FV is Rs.5, then the number of shares would be 1 crore, so on and so forth.

A total of 50 lakh shares is called the **Authorized shares** of the company. These shares have to be allotted amongst the promoter, and two angels plus the company has to retain some amount of shares with itself to be issued in the future.

So let us assume the promoter retains 40% of the shares, and the two angels get 5% each, and the company retains 50% of the shares. Since the promoter and two angels own 50% of the shares, this allotted portion is called **Issued shares**.

The shareholding pattern of this company would look something like this:

![](images/angel_investor.png) 
Please note the company retains the balance of 50% of the shares totalling 2,500,000 equity shares. These shares are authorized but not allotted.

#### The Venture Capitalist

When business starts generating revenue and the promotor wants more money to expand business then VC's can be approached for investments.  Let us assume he meets one such professional investor who agrees to give him 7 Crs for a 14% stake in his company.

The investor who typically invests in such an early stage of business is called a **Venture Capitalist (VC)**, and the money that the business gets at this stage is called **Series A funding.**

After the company agrees to allot 14% to the VC from the authorized capital, the shareholding pattern looks like this:

![](images/VC_shares.png)

Note, the balance 36% of shares is still retained within the company and has not been issued.

With the VC’s money coming into the business, an exciting development has taken place. **The VC values the entire business at INR 50 Crs by valuing his 14% stake in the company at INR 7Crs.** 

With the valuations going up, the investments made by the initial investors will have an impact. The following table summarizes the same…

![](images/VC_value.png)

Going forward with our story, the promoter now has the additional capital he requires for the business. The company gets an additional manufacturing unit and a few more retail outlets in the city as planned. Things are going great; the popularity of the product grows, translating into higher revenues. The management team gets more professional, thereby increasing the operational efficiency, which translates to better profits.

#### The Banker

The company decides to have a retail presence in at least 3 more cities. To back the retail presence across three cities, the company also plans to increase the production capacity and hire more resources. Whenever a company plans such expenditure to improve the overall business, the expenditure is called **‘Capital Expenditure’ or simply ‘CAPEX’**.

The management estimates 40Crs towards their CAPEX requirements. How does the company get this money or in other words, how can the company fund its CAPEX requirements?

There are few options with the company to raise the required funds for their CAPEX:

* The company has made some profits over the last few years; a part of the CAPEX requirement can be funded through the profits. This is also called funding through **internal accruals**.
* The company can approach another VC and raise another round of VC funding by allotting shares from the authorized capital – this is called **Series B funding.**
* The company can approach a bank and seek a loan. The bank would be happy to tender this loan as the company has been doing fairly well. The loan is also called **‘Debt.’**  

The company decides to exercise all three options at its disposal to raise funds for Capex. It ploughs 15Crs from internal accruals, plans a series B – divests 5% equity for a consideration of 10Crs from another VC and raises 15Crs debt from the banker.

**Note, with 10Crs coming in for 5%, the company’s valuation now stands at 200 Crs.**

The shareholding and valuation look something like this:

![](images/bank_shares.png)

Note, the company still has 31% of shares not allotted to shareholders now being valued at 62 Crs.  

#### The Private Equity

The company decides to raise the bar and branch out across the country. The CAPEX requirement for the new ambition is now pegged at 60 Crs. The company does not want to raise money through debt because of the interest rate burden, also called the **finance charges**, which would eat away the company’s profits.

They decide to allot shares from the authorized capital for a Series C funding. They cannot approach a typical VC because VC funding is usually small and runs into a few crores. This is when a **Private Equity (PE) investor** comes into the picture.

PE investors are quite savvy. They are highly qualified and have an excellent professional background. They invest large amounts of money to provide the capital for constructive use and place their own people on the board of the investee company to ensure the company steers in the required direction.

Assuming they pick up a 15% stake for a consideration of 60Crs, they are now valuing **the company at 400Crs**.  
Let’s have a quick look at the shareholding and valuations:

![](images/PE_shares.png)


Please note, the company has retained a 16% stake which has not been allotted to any shareholder. This portion is valued at 64 Crs.

Usually, when a PE invests, they invest intending to fund large CAPEX requirements. Besides, they do not invest in the early stage of a business; instead, they prefer to invest in companies that already have a revenue stream, and are in operation for a few years. Deploying the PE capital and utilizing the capital for the CAPEX requirements takes up a few years.

### The IPO

Company has successfully diversified their product portfolio and have a presence across all the major cities in the country.  
The promoter now aspires to go international! He wants his brand to be available across all the major international cities.  
This time around the CAPEX requirement is huge, and the management estimates this at 200 Crs.   

The company has few options to fund the CAPEX requirement.

1. Fund Capex from internal accruals
1. Raise Series D from another PE fund
1. Raise debt from bankers
1. Float a bond (this is another form of raising debt)
1. File for an Initial Public Offer (IPO) by allotting shares from authorized capital
1. A combination of all the above


For convenience, let us assume the company decides to fund the CAPEX partly through internal accruals and files for an IPO. When a company files for an IPO, they have to offer their shares to the general public. The general public will subscribe to the shares (i.e. if they want to) by paying a certain price. Now, because the company is offering the shares for the first time to the public, it is called the **“Initial Public Offer".**

#### Why do companies go public?

When a company decides to file for an IPO, invariably the main reason is to raise funds to fuel their CAPEX requirement.   
The promoter has 3 advantages by taking his company public:

1. He is raising funds to meet CAPEX requirement
1. He is avoiding the need to raise debt which means he does not have to pay finance charges which translates to better profitability
1. Whenever you buy a share of a company, you are in essence taking the same amount of risk as the promoter is taking. 

There are other advantages as well in going for an IPO…

* Provide an exit for early investors 
* Reward employees 
* Improve visibility - Going public definitely increases visibility as the company has a status of being publicly held and traded. There is a greater chance of people’s interest in the company, consequently creating a positive impact on its growth.

Now the company requires 200 Crs to fund their CAPEX and the management had decided to fund this partly by internal accrual and partly by filing for an IPO.

Do recollect that the company still has 16% of authorized capital translating to 800,000 shares which are not allotted. The last valuation of these shares when the PE firm invested in Series B was 64Crs. The company has progressed really well ever since the PE firm has invested and naturally the valuation of these shares would have gone up.

For the sake of simplicity, let us assume the company is now valuing the 16% shares anywhere between 125 Crs to 150 Crs. This translates to a per-share value, anywhere between Rs.1562 to Rs.1875/-…(125Crs/8lakh).
So if the company puts 16% on the block to the public, they are likely to raise anywhere between 125 to 150 Crs. The remainder has to come from internal accruals. So naturally, the more money they raise, the better it is for the company.

#### Merchant Bankers

Having decided to go public, the company must now do a series of things to ensure a successful initial public offering. The first and foremost step would be to appoint a merchant banker. Merchant bankers are also called Book Running Lead Managers (BRLM)/Lead Manager (LM). The job of a merchant banker is to assist the company with various aspects of the IPO process including:

* **Underwrite shares** – By underwriting shares, merchant bankers essentially agree to buy all or part of the IPO shares and resell the same to the public
* Should work closely with the company and prepare their listing documents including **Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP)**
* Help the company arrive at the **price band for the IPO**. A price band is the lower and upper limit of the share price within which the company will go public. In the case of our example, the price band will be Rs.1562/- and Rs.1875/-
* Help the company with the roadshows – This is like a promotional/marketing activity for the company’s IPO
* Appointment of other intermediaries namely, registrars, bankers, advertising agencies, etc. The Lead manager also makes various marketing strategies for the issue.  

Once the company partners with the merchant banker, they will work towards taking the company public.


#### IPO sequence of events

Needless to say, each and every step involved in the IPO sequence has to happen under the SEBI guidelines

* **Appoint a merchant banker**. In case of a large public issue, the company can appoint more than 1 merchant banker
* **Apply to SEBI with a registration statement** – The registration statement contains details on what the company does, why the company plans to go public and the financial health of the company
* **Getting a nod from SEBI** – Once SEBI receives the registration statement, SEBI takes a call on whether to issue a go-ahead or a ‘no go’ to the IPO
* **DRHP** – If the company gets the initial SEBI nod, then the company needs to prepare the DRHP. A DRHP is a document that gets circulated to the public. Along with a lot of information, DRHP should contain the following details:

		1. The estimated size of the IPO
		2. The estimated number of shares being offered to the public
		3. Why the company wants to go public and how does the company plan to utilize the funds along with the timeline projection of fund utilization
		4. Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details
		5. Complete financial statements
		6. Management Discussion and Analysis – how the company perceives future business operations to emerge
		7. Risks involved in the business
		8. Management details and their background

* **Market the IPO** – This would involve TV and print advertisements in order to build awareness about the company and its IPO offering. This process is also called the IPO roadshow
* **Fix the price band** – Decide the price band between which the company would like to go public. Of course, this can’t be way off the general perception. If it is, then the public will not subscribe for the IPO
* **Book Building** – Once the roadshow is done and the price band fixed the company now has to officially open the window during which the public can subscribe for shares. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.120, then the public can actually choose a price they think is fair enough for the IPO issue. The process of collecting all these price points along with the respective quantities is called Book Building. Book building is perceived as an effective price discovery method
* **Closure** – After the book building window is closed (generally open for few days) then the price point at which the issue gets listed is decided. This price point is usually the price at which maximum bids have been received.
* **Listing Day** – This is the day when the company actually gets listed on the stock exchange. The listing price is the price decided based on market demand and supply on that day and the stock is listed at a premium, par or discount of the cut-off price

#### What happens after the IPO?

During the bidding process (also called the date of issue) investors can bid for shares at a particular price within the specified price band.  This whole system around the date of the issue where one bids for shares, is referred to as the Primary Market. The moment the stock gets listed and debuts on the stock exchange, the stock starts to trade publicly. This is called the secondary market.

Once the stock transitions from primary markets to secondary markets, the stock gets traded daily on the stock exchange. People start buying and selling stocks regularly.

#### Few key IPO jargons

* **Under subscription** – Let’s say the company wants to offer 100,000 shares to the public. During the book-building process, it is discovered that only 90,000 bids were received, then the issue is said to be under subscribed. This is not a great situation to be in as it indicates negative public sentiment

* **Oversubscription** – If there are 200,000 bids for 100,000 shares on offer then the issue is said to be oversubscribed 2 times (2x)

* **Green Shoe Option** – Part of the underwriting agreement which allows the issuer to authorize additional shares (typically 15 percent) to be distributed in the event of oversubscription. This is also called the overallotment option

* **Fixed Price IPO** – Sometimes the companies fix the price of the IPO and do not opt for a price band. Such issues are called fixed price IPO

* **Price Band and Cut off price** – Price band is a price range between which the stock gets listed. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.130, then the issue can list within the range. Let’s says it gets listed at 125, then 125 is called the cut off price.


## Stock Market - Basics

**Authorized shares** - refer to the largest number of shares that a single corporation can issue. The number of authorized shares per company is assessed at the company's creation and can only be increased or decreased through a vote by the shareholders

**Treasury** - Shares hold by company itself

**Restricted Shares** - refer to a company's issued stock that cannot be bought or sold without special permission

**Float Shares** -  refers to a company's shares that are freely bought and sold without restrictions by the public

**Outstanding Shares = Restricted  shares + float shares**

Let's assume company XYZ. the company has 1,000 authorized shares. If it offered 300 shares in an IPO, gave 150 to the executives, and retained 550 in the treasury, then the number of shares outstanding would be 450 shares (300 float shares + 150 restricted shares). If after a couple of years XYZ was doing extremely well and wanted to buy back 100 shares from the market, the number of outstanding shares would fall to 350, the number of treasury shares would increase to 650 and the float would fall to 200 shares since the buyback was done through the market (300 – 100).

### How to calculate returns?

Returns are usually expressed in terms of annual yield. There are different kinds of returns that you need to be aware of.

**Absolute Return** – This is return that your trade or investment has generated in absolute terms. It helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it 3550. How much percentage return did I generate?

The formula to calculate the same is [(Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value) – 1]*100

i.e [(3550/3030) -1] * 100

= [1.1716 -1] * 100

= 0.1716 * 100

= 17.16%

A 17.6% is not a bad return at all!

**Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** – An absolute return can be misleading if you want to compare two investments. CAGR helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030 and held the stock for 2 years and sold it 3550. At what rate did my investment grow over the last two years?

CAGR factors in the time component which we had ignored when we computed the absolute return.

The formula to calculate CAGR is ..

CAGR = [ { (Ending value / Beginning Value) ^ (1/N) } -1 ] * 100

i.e [ { (3550/3030)^(1/2) } -1 ] * 100

= [ { (1.1716)^(1/2) } -1 ] * 100

= [ 1.082 -1 ] * 100

= 0.82 * 100

= 8.2%

Always use **CAGR** when you want to check returns over multiple years. Use **absolute return** when your time frame is for a year or lesser.


What if you have bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550 within 6 months? In that case you have generated 17.16% in 6 months which translates to 34.32% (17.16% * 2) for the year.

So the point is, if you have to compare returns, its best done when the return is expressed on an annualized basis.

### Types of Traders

1. **Day Trader** – A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward his positions. He is risk averse and does not like taking overnight risk. For example – He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day.
1. **Scalper** – A type of a day trader. He usually trades very large quantities of shares and holds the stock for very less time with an intention to make a small but quick profit. For example – He would buy 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sell it 2212.1 at 9.16. He ends up making 1000/- profit in this trade. In a typical day, he would have placed many such trades. As you may have noticed a scalp trader is highly risk averse.
1. **Swing Trader** – A swing trader holds on to his trade for slightly longer time duration, the duration can run into anywhere between few days to weeks. He is typically more open to taking risks. For example – He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12th June 2014 and sell it 2214 on 19th June 2014.

### Types of Investors

An investor is a person who buys a stock expecting a significant appreciation in the stock. He is willing to wait for his investment to evolve. The typical holding period of investors usually runs into a few years. There are two popular types of investors..

1. **Growth Investors** – The objective here is to identify companies which are expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape thereby creating massive wealth for its shareholders.
1. **Value Investors** – The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in growth phase or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short term market sentiment thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is L&T. Due to short term negative sentiment; L&T was beaten down significantly around August/September of 2013. The stock price collapsed to 690 all the way from 1200. At 690 (given its fundamentals around Aug 2013), a company like L&T is perceived as cheap, and therefore a great value pick. Eventually it did pay off, as the stock price scaled back to 1440 around May 2014.

### The Index


If I were to ask you how the stock market is moving today, how would you answer my question? There are approximately 5,000 listed companies in the Bombay Stock Exchange and about 2,000 listed companies on the National Stock Exchange. It would be clumsy to check every company, figure out if they are up or down for the day and then give a detailed answer.


Luckily you need not actually track these selected companies individually to get a sense of how the markets are doing. The important companies are pre-packaged and continuously monitored to give you this information. This pre-packaged market information tool is called the **‘Market Index’.**

There are two main market indices in India. The **S&P BSE Sensex** representing the Bombay stock exchange and **CNX Nifty** representing the National Stock exchange.

**S&P stands for Standard and Poor’s**, a global credit rating agency. S&P has the technical expertise in constructing the index which they have licensed to the BSE. Hence the index also carries the S&P tag.

CNX Nifty consists of the largest and most frequently traded stocks within the National Stock Exchange. It is maintained by India Index Services & Products Limited (IISL), a joint venture of the National Stock Exchange and CRISIL. In fact, the term **‘CNX’** stands for CRISIL and NSE.

An ideal index gives us minute by minute reading about how the market participants perceive the future. The movements in the Index reflect the changing expectations of the market participants. When the index goes up, it is because the market participants think the future will be better. The index drops if the market participants perceive the future pessimistically


### Practical uses of the Index

* **Information** – The index reflects the general market trend for a period of time. The index is a broad representation of the country’s state of the economy. A stock market index that up indicates people are optimistic about the future. Likewise, when the stock market index is down, people are pessimistic about the future.

* **Benchmarking** – For all the trading or investing activity that one does, a yardstick to measure the performance is required.  Assume over the last 1 year you invested Rs.100,000/- and generated Rs.20,000 return to make your total corpus Rs.120,000/-. How do you think you performed? Well on the face of it, a 20% return looks great. However, what if Nifty moved to 7,800 points from 6,000 points generating a return on 30% during the same year?

	Well, suddenly it may seem to you that you have underperformed the market! If not for the Index, you can’t really figure out how you performed in the stock market. You need the index to benchmark the performance of a trader or investor. Usually, the objective of market participants is to outperform the Index.

* **Trading** – Trading on the index is probably one of the most popular uses of the index. Majority of the traders in the market trade the index. They take a broader call on the economy or general state of affairs and translate that into a trade.

	For example, imagine this situation. At 10:30 AM, the Finance Minister is expected to deliver his budget speech. An hour before the announcement Nifty index is at 6,600 points. You expect the budget to be favourable to the nation’s economy. What do you think will happen to the index? Naturally, the index will move up. So to trade your point of view, you may want to buy the index at 6,600. After all, the index is the representation of the broader economy.

	So as per your expectation, the budget is good, and the index moves to 6,900. You can now book your profits, and exit the trade at a 300 points profit!  Trades such as these are possible through what is known as the ‘Derivative’ segment of the markets.

* **Portfolio Hedging** – Investors usually build a portfolio of securities. A typical portfolio contains 10 – 12 stocks which they would have bought from a long term perspective. While the stocks are held from a long term perspective, they could foresee a prolonged adverse movement in the market (2008), potentially eroding the capital in the portfolio. In such a situation, investors can use the index to hedge the portfolio.

### Index construction methodology

The Index is a composition of many stocks from different sectors that collectively represent the economy’s state. To include a stock in the index, it should qualify certain criteria. Once qualified as an index stock, it should continue to qualify on the stated criteria. If it fails to maintain the criteria, the stock gets replaced by another stock that qualifies the prerequisites.

Based on the selection procedure, the list of stocks is populated. Each stock in the index should be assigned a certain weightage. Weightage in simpler terms defines how much importance a certain stock in the index gets compared to the others

There are many ways to assign weights, but the Indian stock exchange follows a **free-float market capitalization** method. The weights are assigned based on the company’s free-float market capitalization, the larger the market capitalization, the higher is the weight.

**Free float market capitalization is the product of the total number of shares outstanding in the market and the stock price.**

**Free float market cap = outstsanding shares * stock price**

For example company, ABC has 100 shares outstanding in the market, and the stock price is at 50 then the free-float market cap of ABC is 100*50 = Rs.5,000.

The following are the 50 stocks in Nifty as per their weightage

![](images/nifty50.png)

### Sector-specific indices

While the Sensex and Nifty represent the broader markets, certain indices represent specific sectors. These are called the sectoral indices. For example, the **Bank Nifty** on NSE represents the mood specific to the banking industry. The **CNX IT** on NSE represents the behaviour of all the IT stocks in the stock markets. Both BSE and NSE have sector-specific indexes.  The construction and maintenance of these indices are similar to the other major indices.
