##Why to Invest

1. **Fight Inflation** – By investing one can deal better with the inevitable – growing cost of living – generally referred to as Inflation
2. **Create Wealth** – By investing, one can aim to have a better corpus by the end of the defined time period. In the above example, the time period was up to retirement, but it can be anything – children’s education, marriage, house purchase, retirement holidays, etc
3. To meet life’s financial aspiration

##Regulators

In India, the stock market regulator is called **The Securities and Exchange Board of India**, often referred to as SEBI.
In general, SEBI ensures:

The stock exchanges *(BSE and NSE)* conducts its business fairly
Stockbrokers and sub-brokers conduct their business fairly
Participants don’t get involved in unfair practices
Corporate’s don’t use the markets to unduly benefit themselves (Example – Satyam Computers)
Small retail investors interests are protected
Large investors with huge cash pile should not manipulate the markets
Overall development of markets

##Financial Intermediaries

### 1. Stock broker 
A stockbroker is a corporate entity, registered as a trading member with the stock exchange and holds a stockbroking license. A stockbroker is your gateway to stock exchanges. First, you need to open something called a **‘Trading Account’** with a broker who meets your requirements.  
A trading account lets you carry financial transactions in the market. A trading account is an account with the broker, which lets the investor buy/sell securities.

The basic services provided by the brokers include…

1. Give you access to markets and letting you transact
1. Give you margins for trading – We will discuss this point at a later stage.
1. Provide support – Dealing support if you have to call and trade. Software support if you have issues with the trading terminal
1. Issue contract notes for the transactions – A contract note is a written confirmation detailing the transactions you have carried out during the day.
1. Facilitate the fund transfer between your trading and bank account
1. Provide you with a back-office login – using which you can see the summary of your account
1. The broker charges a fee for the services he provides called the ‘brokerage charge’ or just brokerage. The brokerage rates vary, and it’s upto you to find a broker who strikes a balance between the fee he collects versus the services he provides.

### 2. Depository and Depository Participants

Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format; however post 1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. Converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called “Dematerialization” often abbreviated as DEMAT. The share certificate in DEMAT format has to be stored digitally. The storage place for the digital share certificate is the **‘DEMAT Account’**.  
A Depository is a financial intermediary which offers the service of the Demat account. A DEMAT account in your name will have all the shares in the electronic format you bought. Think of the DEMAT account as a digital vault for your shares.  
your broker’s trading account and the DEMAT account from the Depository are interlinked.  

At present, only two depositaries are offering you DEMAT account services. They are The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited. There is virtually no difference between the two, and both of them operate under strict SEBI regulations.

Just like the way you cannot walk into National Stock Exchange’s office to open a trading account, you cannot walk into a Depository to open a DEMAT account. To open a DEMAT account, you need to liaison with a Depository Participant (DP). A DP helps you set up your DEMAT account with a Depository. A DP acts as an agent to the Depository. Needless to say, even the DP is governed by the regulations laid out by the SEBI.

### 3. Banks

Banks help in facilitating the fund transfer from your bank account to your trading account. You cannot transfer money from a bank account that is not in your name.  
You can link multiple bank accounts to your trading through which you can transfer funds and trade. At Zerodha, you can add 1 primary bank account and up to 2 secondary bank accounts. You can use all the bank accounts to add funds, but withdrawals are only processed to the primary bank account. Also, dividend payments, money from buybacks will be sent to the primary bank account.

The three financial intermediaries operate via three different accounts – ***trading account, DEMAT account and Bank account***. All three accounts operate electronically and are interlinked, giving you a very seamless experience.

### 4. NSCCL and ICCL

NSCCL – National Security Clearing Corporation Ltd and Indian Clearing Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries of National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange.
The job of the clearing corporation is to ensure guaranteed settlement of your trades/transactions.  
For all practical purposes, it’s ok not to know much about NSCCL or ICCL simply because, you as a trader or investor would not be interacting with these agencies directly. You need to be aware that certain professional institutions are heavily regulated and work towards a smooth settlement and efficient clearing activity.

##The IPO Markets 

###Origin of a Business

####Angel Investors. 
They believe in **Promotors** (Founders of the company) and invest money. So let us imagine that the promoter, along with the angels, raises INR 5 Crore in the capital. This initial money that he gets to kick start his business is called **‘The Seed Fund’**. It is important to note that the seed fund will not sit in the entrepreneur’s (also called the promoter) personal bank account but instead sits in its bank account. Once the seed capital hits the company’s bank account, the money will be referred to as the company’s initial share capital.

In return for the initial seed investment, the original three (promoter plus 2 angels) will be issued share certificates of the company which entitles them to the company.

The only asset that the company has at this stage is the cash of INR 5 Crs, the company’s value is also INR 5 Crs. This is called the company’s **valuation**.  
Issuing shares is quite simple; the company assumes that each share is worth Rs.10 and because there is Rs.5 crore as share capital, there have to be 50 lakh shares with each share worth Rs.10. In this context, Rs.10 is called the ‘Face value’ (FV) of the share. The face value could be any number. If the FV is Rs.5, then the number of shares would be 1 crore, so on and so forth.

A total of 50 lakh shares is called the **Authorized shares** of the company. These shares have to be allotted amongst the promoter, and two angels plus the company has to retain some amount of shares with itself to be issued in the future.

So let us assume the promoter retains 40% of the shares, and the two angels get 5% each, and the company retains 50% of the shares. Since the promoter and two angels own 50% of the shares, this allotted portion is called **Issued shares**.

The shareholding pattern of this company would look something like this:

Please note the company retains the balance of 50% of the shares totalling 2,500,000 equity shares. These shares are authorized but not allotted.
