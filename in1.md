### Current assets

**Any asset which can be converted into cash within next 12 months is called Current assets.**

![](img/in254.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in255.png)
![](img/in256.png)

Most of the Current assets are Intangible assets.  
You can notice for B2B company trade receivables is huge because of payment terms.  
Whereas for B2C company trade receivables is less because of cash is paid in upfront when product is delivered

### Non-Current assets

![](img/in260.png)
![](img/in261.png)

Always check note, whenever you see big numbers in Current and Non-Current assets then do check why is it so?  
Any abnormal indication or doubt then check in full swing to understand what and where the money is from or into?

### Liabilities

### Liabilities – Current vs Non-Current

**Current Liability -** Has to repay within next 12 months. Most dangerous    
**Non-Current Liability -** Long term debt has to repay in future. But its not compulsion to repay within next 12 months

### Key Ratios : Current Ratio

* Current ratio > 3 = Excellent company
* Current ratio > 2 = Good company
* Current ratio > 1 = Better company
* Current ratio < 1 = Bad company, rethink before investing
* Current ratio < 0.5 = Worst, don't even think about it

### Equity Share Capital

Equity shared capital - Funds raised by giving out shares of the company

### When you buy a stock, are you adding to share capital?

NO. Because basically, you are buying from the secondary market that is from another trader not from the company directly. Only when we directly buy from the company through IPO or FPO then it gets contributed to Equity share capital.

Let's End Mr.Singh's example over here. So we learnt about the difference between Expenditure and Expenses. Also knew about Depreciation which is in P/L statement and Accumulated Depreciation in Balance Sheet

### Income/Revenue

![](img/in327.png)

The money that is generated by selling their products or services is called Income or Revenue.  
In India we follow, IND AS (Indian Accounting standard) to report financials.   
Every public company follows this standard hence it is easy for us to go through the report to compare and understand the line items with respect to every other company

![](img/in329.png)

### Expenses: Cost of material consumed

Margin = Revenue - Expenses

### Expenses: Purchase of Stock-in Trade

![](img/in337.png)
![](img/in338.png)
![](img/in339.png)

### Expenses: Change in Inventories

Inventory - Raw material or work-in-progress product or Finished product. It can be any of these three.  
For ex. Maruti Company - Tyres in warehouse or cars under production or cars in showroom for sale. All these are Inventory

Change in Inventory is for Matching purpose.  
Matching means "Matching the Revenue with Expenses during that period"

![](img/in340.png)
![](img/in341.png)
![](img/in342.png)

When Change in Inventory is in negative, then it means "More products were produced than actually what was sold"  
When Change in Inventory is in positive, then it means "Less products were produced than actually what was sold"

### Expenses: Employee Benefits

![](img/in345.png)
![](img/in147.png)
![](img/in346.png)

IT Sector spends more money for its employees. Hence lavish lifestyle for IT people

![](img/in347.png)

Manufacturing sectors spends more only on its raw materials and hence spends less on employee expenses
